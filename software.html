    <h1 class="head">About Molding Software</h1>
    <p>Designing  is essential to building a better and more cost-effective mold with shorter leadtimes.<br>  A variety of software is available to help overcome the daily challenges faced with data, quoting, designing and programmingâ€”including computer-aided design
        (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and data management software. CAM is used to generate machining programs corresponding to part designs;
        CAD is used for detailed engineering of 3-D models and/or 2-D drawings.<br>
        we made a application for 2D designing , we made it with the help of html canvas and javascript.
